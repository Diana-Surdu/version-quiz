Semantic Version (or its short form - Semver) is a way of numbering a software release, and it uses a three numbersystem instead of a two number system of a release number of a software.
No, they are not compatible, because the major version number has been changed from 1 to 2 so the API actually had been broken, there is no backwards compatibility with the old API
0.0 x represents a version of a software that is in a process of forming but is not actually public to begin using. 
"Alpha" is a type of testing performed by distributing a software system, ready to be released, to a group of users internal to the company that developed the software. "Beta" is the next step after the alpha testing - releasing the software to a selected subset of users, outside the organisation. "rc" - release candidates. "Snapshot" is the content (files and folders) of a repository at some point in time. It is the same like a screenshot to a video.
A branch is a structure that helps to work on multiple tasks or features at once.
The opposite of push is pull.
